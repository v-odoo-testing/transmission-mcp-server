# Transmission MCP Server Development Log

## Project Overview
This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for controlling Transmission torrent daemon remotely. The server provides tools for managing torrents, directories, and network connections through both local and remote access methods (SSH tunneling, SOCKS5 proxy).

**Target Environment:**
- Transmission daemon version: 3.00 (bb6b5a062e)
- Server location: 192.168.1.205:9091
- RPC endpoint: /transmission/rpc
- Authentication: Basic auth required

## Development Sessions

### Session 1: Project Planning & Research (2025-06-30)

**Objectives:**
- Research Transmission RPC API specification
- Create comprehensive implementation plan
- Set up project structure
- Define development phases and milestones

**Activities Completed:**
1. **API Research**: Analyzed Transmission RPC specification including:
   - Core RPC methods: session-get, torrent-add, torrent-get, free-space
   - Authentication handling: Basic auth + X-Transmission-Session-Id CSRF protection
   - Request/response format: JSON over HTTP POST
   - Error handling: 409 responses for session ID refresh

2. **Architecture Design**: Defined modular structure with:
   - Core RPC client with session management
   - Network abstraction for direct/SSH/SOCKS5 connections
   - MCP tool implementations for torrent/directory/session management
   - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

3. **Project Structure**: Created directory layout and defined:
   - src/transmission_mcp/ main package
   - Separate modules for transmission, network, and tools
   - Testing infrastructure with unit and integration tests
   - Configuration management with Pydantic

4. **Simplified Implementation**: User requested simplified approach:
   - Single-file implementation instead of complex module structure
   - Direct git clone usage instead of pip install
   - Simple venv + requirements.txt setup
   - Claude Desktop JSON config with environment variables

5. **Complete Implementation**: Built full working MCP server in single session:
   - `src/server.py` - Complete MCP server with Transmission RPC client
   - Support for direct connection and SOCKS5 proxy
   - All core tools: session info, torrent management, free space checking
   - Environment variable configuration for easy setup

**Key Technical Decisions (Final):**
- Single-file architecture for simplicity and ease of deployment
- httpx with SOCKS5 proxy support via PySocks
- Pydantic for clean configuration management
- Environment variable based configuration
- MCP framework integration with proper tool schemas

**Files Created:**
- `src/server.py` - Main MCP server (346 lines)
- `requirements.txt` - Simple dependency list
- `claude-desktop-config.json` - Ready-to-use Claude config with dual setups
- `README.md` - Complete setup and usage guide
- `test_connection.py` - Connection testing utility
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version tracking
- `.gitignore` - Standard Python gitignore
- Git repository initialized with initial commit

**Completed Objectives:**
- ✅ Full working MCP server implementation
- ✅ Direct and SOCKS5 proxy connection support
- ✅ All planned torrent management tools
- ✅ Claude Desktop integration ready
- ✅ Simple setup process (git clone, venv, pip install)
- ✅ Documentation and testing utilities

**Research Sources:**
- Official Transmission RPC specification on GitHub
- transmission-rpc Python library documentation
- Various community implementations and examples
- Security best practices for RPC clients

**Notes:**
- Transmission version 3.00 is well-established with stable RPC API
- CSRF protection via session ID is critical for security
- Need to handle both torrent IDs and hash strings for identification
- Directory listing may require custom implementation or file system access

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use type hints throughout (Python 3.8+ features)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add docstrings for all public methods
- Use dataclasses/Pydantic models for structured data

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for each development phase
- Descriptive commit messages with scope
- Regular commits for incremental progress
- Tags for major milestones and releases

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests with mock and real daemon
- Network connectivity tests for all modes
- Error handling and edge case validation

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation with examples
- Configuration guide for all connection modes
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Development setup instructions

### Security Practices
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure defaults for all settings
- Audit logging for administrative operations

## Technical Decisions Log

### 2025-06-30: Simplified Single-File Architecture
- **Architecture Change**: Switched from modular to single-file approach per user request
- **HTTP Client**: httpx with SOCKS5 proxy support for both direct and remote access
- **Data Models**: Pydantic for configuration, simple dict handling for RPC responses  
- **Error Handling**: Basic exception handling with informative error messages
- **Network Support**: Direct HTTP and SOCKS5 proxy modes with runtime switching
- **Configuration**: Pure environment variable configuration for simplicity

### Dependencies Rationale
- `mcp`: Official MCP framework for tool registration
- `httpx`: Modern HTTP client with async support
- `pydantic`: Data validation and settings management
- `paramiko`: SSH client for secure tunneling
- `PySocks`: SOCKS proxy support
- `typing-extensions`: Enhanced type hints for better IDE support

---

## Known Limitations & Considerations

### Transmission RPC Quirks
- Integer torrent IDs not stable across daemon restarts (use hash strings)
- Session ID expires and requires 409 response handling
- Some operations require specific field requests to avoid large responses
- Directory operations may need file system access beyond RPC

### Network Connectivity
- SSH tunneling handled separatly and uses pub/priv key auth
- SOCKS5 proxy without auth
- Connection mode switching needs graceful fallback
- Remote access patterns vary by network configuration

### Performance Considerations
- Large torrent lists may need pagination
- File listings within torrents can be extensive
- Session statistics updates frequently
- Connection establishment overhead for remote access

### rules

- changelog.md is append only, no editing, write in append mode
- need git commit with usefull message on each step or iteration
- create with gh client new repo at https://github.com/v-odoo-testing/transmission-mcp-server

---

## Future Enhancement Ideas

### v2.0 Features
- Multi-daemon support for managing multiple servers
- Web UI integration for visual management
- RSS feed monitoring for automatic downloads
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Bandwidth scheduling and automation

### Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling for HTTP requests
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Async operations for better responsiveness
- Request batching for bulk operations
