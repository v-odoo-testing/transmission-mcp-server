# Transmission MCP Server Development Log

## Project Overview
This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for controlling Transmission torrent daemon remotely. The server provides tools for managing torrents, directories, and network connections through both local and remote access methods (SSH tunneling, SOCKS5 proxy).

**Target Environment:**
- Transmission daemon version: 3.00 (bb6b5a062e)
- Server location: 192.168.1.205:9091
- RPC endpoint: /transmission/rpc
- Authentication: Basic auth required

## Development Sessions

### Session 1: Project Planning & Research (2025-06-30)

**Objectives:**
- Research Transmission RPC API specification
- Create comprehensive implementation plan
- Set up project structure
- Define development phases and milestones

**Activities Completed:**
1. **API Research**: Analyzed Transmission RPC specification including:
   - Core RPC methods: session-get, torrent-add, torrent-get, free-space
   - Authentication handling: Basic auth + X-Transmission-Session-Id CSRF protection
   - Request/response format: JSON over HTTP POST
   - Error handling: 409 responses for session ID refresh

2. **Architecture Design**: Defined modular structure with:
   - Core RPC client with session management
   - Network abstraction for direct/SSH/SOCKS5 connections
   - MCP tool implementations for torrent/directory/session management
   - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

3. **Project Structure**: Created directory layout and defined:
   - src/transmission_mcp/ main package
   - Separate modules for transmission, network, and tools
   - Testing infrastructure with unit and integration tests
   - Configuration management with Pydantic

4. **Implementation Plan**: Outlined 6-phase development approach:
   - Phase 1: Core infrastructure and HTTP client
   - Phase 2: Torrent management operations  
   - Phase 3: Directory and space management
   - Phase 4: Network connectivity (SSH/SOCKS5)
   - Phase 5: MCP integration and tools
   - Phase 6: Testing and documentation

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Use httpx for modern HTTP client with async support
- Implement connection abstraction for multiple network modes
- Pydantic models for data validation and settings
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exception hierarchy
- Security-first approach with credential protection

**Files Created:**
- `/Users/dgoo2308/git/transmission-mcp-server/` (project directory)
- Implementation plan with detailed architecture
- TODO list with phased development approach

**Next Session Goals:**
- Set up basic project structure (pyproject.toml, src/ directory)
- Implement core TransmissionClient class
- Create basic RPC methods (session-get, torrent-get)
- Test connectivity with actual daemon

**Research Sources:**
- Official Transmission RPC specification on GitHub
- transmission-rpc Python library documentation
- Various community implementations and examples
- Security best practices for RPC clients

**Notes:**
- Transmission version 3.00 is well-established with stable RPC API
- CSRF protection via session ID is critical for security
- Need to handle both torrent IDs and hash strings for identification
- Directory listing may require custom implementation or file system access

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use type hints throughout (Python 3.8+ features)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add docstrings for all public methods
- Use dataclasses/Pydantic models for structured data

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for each development phase
- Descriptive commit messages with scope
- Regular commits for incremental progress
- Tags for major milestones and releases

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests with mock and real daemon
- Network connectivity tests for all modes
- Error handling and edge case validation

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation with examples
- Configuration guide for all connection modes
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Development setup instructions

### Security Practices
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure defaults for all settings
- Audit logging for administrative operations

## Technical Decisions Log

### 2025-06-30: Initial Architecture
- **HTTP Client**: Selected httpx over requests for async support and modern features
- **Data Models**: Pydantic for validation, type safety, and settings management
- **Error Handling**: Custom exception hierarchy with specific error types
- **Network Abstraction**: Pluggable connection handlers for different access methods
- **Configuration**: Environment variables + optional config files for flexibility

### Dependencies Rationale
- `mcp`: Official MCP framework for tool registration
- `httpx`: Modern HTTP client with async support
- `pydantic`: Data validation and settings management
- `paramiko`: SSH client for secure tunneling
- `PySocks`: SOCKS proxy support
- `typing-extensions`: Enhanced type hints for better IDE support

## Known Limitations & Considerations

### Transmission RPC Quirks
- Integer torrent IDs not stable across daemon restarts (use hash strings)
- Session ID expires and requires 409 response handling
- Some operations require specific field requests to avoid large responses
- Directory operations may need file system access beyond RPC

### Network Connectivity
- SSH tunneling requires key management and connection monitoring
- SOCKS5 proxy may have authentication requirements
- Connection mode switching needs graceful fallback
- Remote access patterns vary by network configuration

### Performance Considerations
- Large torrent lists may need pagination
- File listings within torrents can be extensive
- Session statistics updates frequently
- Connection establishment overhead for remote access

---

## Future Enhancement Ideas

### v2.0 Features
- Multi-daemon support for managing multiple servers
- Web UI integration for visual management
- RSS feed monitoring for automatic downloads
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Bandwidth scheduling and automation

### Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling for HTTP requests
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Async operations for better responsiveness
- Request batching for bulk operations

### Advanced Features
- VPN integration and routing
- Notification system for completion events
- Integration with media management tools
- API rate limiting and quotas
- Advanced logging and monitoring
